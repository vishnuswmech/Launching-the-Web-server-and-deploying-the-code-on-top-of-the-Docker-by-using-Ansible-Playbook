# Launching-the-Web-server-and-deploying-the-code-on-top-of-the-Docker-by-using-Ansible-Playbook
We are going to configuring the Apache Web server and deploying the code on it on the docker container in the managed node by using ansible-playbook.

You can find YAML scripts in docker.yml file.

Here I used Amazon 2 Linux EC2 instance for controller node and managed node.

I used HTTPD docker container image for deployment.
